		<h1 class="h1">Backstory: an idea for putting the news in order</h1>
		<p class="byline">By <a href="http://twitter.com/mattgelfand">Matt Gelfand</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/teenyrobots">Joyce Rice</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/brunning">Ben Running</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/realgoodwill">Will Royal</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/m_swartz">Mike Swartz</a></p>

		<p class="txt">Backstory is a news app that gives readers context. Keeping readers on top of breaking news can be difficult for news outlets, and it can be frustrating for users to follow. Backstory gives readers real time updates to quickly developing stories while allowing them to skim previous headlines/summaries in the order they appeared or from the beginning. Backstory also provides readers with a summary of the developing story and the ability to track key players. This makes it easy for readers to catch up on a big story, review previous developments, and follow the folks involved, all without manually searching or tracking on the part of the user.</p>
